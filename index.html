        <p>Today is my 21st birthday! I am so excited to celebrate. I am on my way to Disneyland! I haven't been to Disneyland in quite some years. I have been looking forward to it for many months. I think the first ride I will go on is the <em>Hauted Mantion</em>. Wish me luck!</p>

        <p>Woo-hoo! Disneyland was above and beyond. It was so much fun. We ent on all of the rides, multiple times. I think my favorite has to be <em>Splash Mountain</em>! That is the ride where everyone is in a "log" riding down a river. Then, at the end, you go down a waterfall! It caught me by surprise. I really loved it! I hope to go back soon.</p>
